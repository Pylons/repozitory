Repozitory is a library for archiving documents and recovering old
versions. It is designed to work in tandem with a primary document
storage mechanism such as ZODB. Repozitory stores the document versions
in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. Repozitory was
built for KARL, an open source online collaboration system, but
Repozitory is intended to be useful for any Python project that stores
user-editable documents.  Repozitory does not require ZODB.
