0.2 (2011-09-15)
----------------

- Added the new_container_ids attribute to deleted item records.  This
  allows undeletion UIs to filter out objects that have moved to another
  container.  It should also allow applications to redirect users to the new
  location of a moved object.  No schema migration is needed.

- Added the get_version method to archives.  The get_version method is more
  efficient than iterating over the entire history of an object.

- Initial release.
